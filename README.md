  - <b>Employ GeoPandas or Folium libraries (optional):</b> These libraries can be used for advanced geospatial processing and visualization.

- **<em><ins>Data Storytelling</ins></em>**
  - <b>Power BI:</b> Develop comprehensive data visualizations using Tableau or Power BI.
  - <b>Effectively communicate key takeaways and insights:</b> Create visualizations that clearly present the findings from the data analysis.

- **<em><ins>Problem-Solving and Decision Making</ins></em>**
  - <b>Apply analytical thinking:</b> Utilize data analysis techniques to investigate factors influencing Airbnb listings.
  - <b>Investigate factors influencing pricing, availability, and other aspects:</b> Analyze factors that impact these aspects of Airbnb listings.
  - <b>Empower stakeholders with data-driven insights:</b> Provide stakeholders with actionable information to guide decision-making.</br></br></br>


## Developer Guide
To run the Streamlit web application, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using pip:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Get MongoDB URI
Log in to your MongoDB Atlas account and navigate to your cluster. Copy the connection string (URI) provided by Atlas.

3. Set Up Connection in Python:
create an account in [**MongoDB Atlas**](https://account.mongodb.com/account/login) and set up a cluster. MongoDB Atlas provides cloud-hosted MongoDB databases that allow you to store and manage your data in a scalable and secure manner. Creating a cluster is necessary to deploy and manage your MongoDB database in the cloud. Use the pymongo library to establish a connection to MongoDB Atlas in your Python script. Here's an example:

```python
from pymongo.mongo_client import MongoClient
from pymongo.server_api import ServerApi

# MongoDB Atlas connection URI
uri = "mongodb+srv://<username>:<password><database>?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=<cluster>"

# Create a new client and connect to the server using the provided URI
Client = MongoClient(uri, server_api=ServerApi('1'))

# Send a ping to confirm a successful connection
Client.admin.command('ping')

# Accessing the desired database and collection
Database = Client.sample_airbnb
Collection = Database.listingsAndReviews
```

3. Run the Application
Once the cluster is created modify it in the code in the python file airbnb.py then you can run the Streamlit application with the following command:

```python
streamlit run airbnb.py
```

4. Access the Application
Once the Streamlit server is running, you can access the application by opening a web browser and navigating to the URL provided by Streamlit, typically http://localhost:8501.

5. Explore the Application
You can now explore the different features and functionalities of the Streamlit application as per your requirements.


## Features
- Data Visualization: Visualize Airbnb data using interactive charts and maps.
- Streamlit Integration: Utilize Streamlit to create a user-friendly web interface for data exploration.
- MongoDB Connectivity: Connect to MongoDB Atlas to retrieve and analyze Airbnb data stored in the cloud.
- Power BI Integration: Embed Power BI visualizations within the Streamlit app for enhanced data presentation.


## Interface
1. ### <em><ins><b>Home Page<b></ins></em></br>
   The home page provides an overview of Airbnb analysis, including a brief description of the application's purpose, skills developed, and domain expertise. It also features a YouTube video embedded to provide additional context.</br></br>
